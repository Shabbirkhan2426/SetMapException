//Each key and value called as Entry
//Map is easy to use if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of key
//Java HaspMap a class which implements the map interface
//Contains ony unque values

The map interface will have unique key value. A key is an object that you use to retreive a value at a later date.
Given a key and a value, you can store the value in a map object. After the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key

Several methods throw a NoSuchElementException when no items exist in the invoking map.
A ClassCastException is thrown when an object is incompatible with the elements in a map
A NullPointer Exception is thrown if an attempt is made to use a null object and null is not allowed in the map
An UnsupportedOperationException is thrown when an attempt is made to change an unmodifiable map.
